coding assessment with the criteria 
Build a React app using your favorite boilerplate or seed (or from scratch), that consists of a login form that sends a login REST post request to this stubbed REST service: https://reqres.in You are free to use whatever tooling you want and whatever libraries you feel best solves the problem. Bonus points if the form looks sharp.

1. The login form should have an email input and a password input.
2. The login form should validate that the email is a valid email input and the password field has at least one character before you process the submit action.
3. You are free to do on change or submit validation – extra points for onChange.
4. Build a unit test for the form – testing both a valid login and an invalid login. you are free to use whatever testing stack you like.
5. Include a “dev” or “run” script in your package.json scripts
6. Include a “test” script in your package.json scripts

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
or npm run start

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
